Important Warning:

Before using this script, it is extremely important to understand the potential consequences. Roblox has strict rules regarding cheating, exploiting, and any form of modification that gives an unfair advantage to players. Using scripts like this one can lead to permanent bans if you are reported by other players.

While this script is intended for educational and development purposes, using it in public games, especially on official Roblox servers or games, could result in severe consequences, including account suspension or banning.

Always ensure you are working within Roblox’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
